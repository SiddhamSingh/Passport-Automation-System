# Passport-Automation-System
Passport Automation System is an interface between the 
Applicant and the Authority responsible for the issue of Passport. If the 
entire process of the issue of the Passport is done manually then it would 
take several months for the Passport to reach the applicant as the 
number of applicants for the Passport are increasing every year. 
Therefore, this system aims at improving the efficiency in the issue of the 
Passport, reduces the complexities involved in it and for the effective 
dispatch of the passport to the maximum possible extent.
